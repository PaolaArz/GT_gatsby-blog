### Don't drink grog. 

My head hurts. I have drunk too much grog yesterday night. 

I woke up with a cooking pot and some meat in my pocket. 


Uh and a Red Herring as well. 
I am scratched all over. It looks like I have been fighting with a seagull to get it. 

Apparently there is a video of me in the bar as well.

Tomorrow I should start working on the trials.
