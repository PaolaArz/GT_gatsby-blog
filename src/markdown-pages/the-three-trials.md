### The Three trials.

I have arrived in Melee Island, it seems a nice island. 
As soon as I arrived to the lookout, a kind old men pointed me to the right direction. 

In the Scumm Bar I met [three important pirates](https://monkeyisland.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Leaders). They don't seem very friendly, but they know what it takes to become a mighty pirate. It looks like I have to pass three trials: 

- Thievery
- Sword Mastery
- Treasure Huntery

I will start tomorrow. I shouldn't have drunk so much grog tonight. I feel my intestine melting.
